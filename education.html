    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>Education is the most powerful tool for empowering women. Access to quality
       education helps women gain knowledge, develop skills, and participate fully
       in society.</p>

    <h3>Key Points</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Importance of literacy for women.</li>
      <li>Scholarships and initiatives for girls’ education.</li>
      <li>Government and NGO efforts in promoting education.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4> women education</h4>
    <p>To conclude the present scenario, it may be said that woman in the modern hi- tech
society which is moving very fast under the shadow of population explosion, conflicts, chaos and
corruption can mold the personality of the adolescent and youth in a proper direction and
perspective, provided the woman are themselves in power.
There is a positive relationship between education and woman empowerment. Another
important aspect in this regard is that, in these societies the issue of women empowerment has
been facing certain serious challenges, which are outcome of some certain evil norms and
attitude such as child labour, child marriage, illiteracy, superstition, partial attitude of the parents,
female feticides, etc. and in such a situation women empowerment is an urgent necessity. In
order to promote women's empowerment, it is necessary to create an environment that will allow
women to participate in educational programs and share the benefits. The educational and other
policies for women empowerment should be implemented in reality for empowering women in
the world.
</p>
<p>The evils of poverty, unemployment and inequality cannot be eradicated by man alone.
Equal and active participation of women is obligatory. Unless women are educated they will not
be able to understand about their rights and their importance. Empowerment of women aims at striving towards acquiring higher literacy level and education, better health care for women and
their children, equal ownership of productive resources, increased participation in economic and
commercial sectors, awareness of their rights, improved standard of living and to achieve selfreliance, self-confidence and self-respect among women. Recently the Government has launched
Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao scheme which aims at making girls independent both socially as well
as financially and which will help in generating awareness and improving the efficiency of
delivery of welfare services meant for women. Such schemes should be implemented nationwide
to bring the desired changes. What should never be forgotten is that women like men need to be
proactive in the process lifelong learning. That is true empowerment. From “women for
development” the time has come to shift focus to “women in development”, with the
cooperation of men through group engagement and management. That will indeed be a „quality‟
change for equality. While being attracted by modernisation and globalisation we must be
confident to say no to marginalization.
