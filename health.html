    <h2>Health</h2>
    <p>Health is the foundation of women empowerment. Ensuring access to quality 
       healthcare helps women live longer, healthier lives and actively contribute 
       to society.</p>

    <h3>Key Focus Areas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Maternal and child healthcare.</li>
      <li>Nutrition and mental health awareness.</li>
      <li>Access to affordable healthcare facilities.</li>
      <li>Government health schemes for women.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Initiatives</h3>
    <p>Programs like <strong>Janani Suraksha Yojana</strong>, <strong>Beti Bachao Beti Padhao</strong>,
       and various NGO-driven campaigns aim to provide better healthcare and awareness 
       for women across all regions.</p>
       <p>Women’s health is a broad and multifaceted domain that spans all stages of life — from adolescence, through reproductive years, to menopause and older age. Key issues include reproductive and maternal health (e.g. prenatal care, safe childbirth, postpartum care), menstrual health and hygiene, prevention and management of non-communicable diseases (such as diabetes, heart disease, and osteoporosis), mental health, nutritional needs (especially iron, folate, calcium), and access to preventive screenings (like cervical cancer, breast cancer). Social determinants such as poverty, education, gender norms, rural/urban divide, and access to healthcare infrastructure deeply influence women’s health outcomes. For instance, in India, maternal mortality and anemia among women of reproductive age remain significant challenges, and disparities in healthcare access are more pronounced in poorer or remote areas.  ￼

The Indian government has recognized many of these challenges and put in place several schemes and programs to promote better women’s health. For example, under the National Health Mission:
	•	Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) encourages institutional deliveries by providing conditional cash transfers to pregnant women.  ￼
	•	Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakaram (JSSK) ensures that pregnant women delivering in public health institutions receive free delivery services (including cesarean), free diagnostics, drugs, diet, blood, and transport.  ￼
	•	Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) offers free comprehensive antenatal care services to women in their 2nd and 3rd trimesters at public health facilities, on a fixed day each month (the 9th).  ￼
	•	Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) gives cash incentives to pregnant and lactating women (for their first surviving child) to improve health, nutrition, and to partially compensate wage loss.  ￼
	•	Rajiv Gandhi Scheme for Empowerment of Adolescent Girls (Sabla / RGSEAG) focuses on adolescent girls (11–18 years) to improve their nutrition, health awareness (menstrual hygiene, adolescent reproductive health), life skills, and support services.  ￼
