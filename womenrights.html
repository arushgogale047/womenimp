These rights ensure that women receive the same opportunities as men in education, employment, politics, and personal life. Under constitutional rights, women are guaranteed equality before the law, freedom from gender-based discrimination, and equal opportunities in every field. Legal rights protect women from domestic violence, sexual harassment at the workplace, and also provide equal share in property and inheritance.
